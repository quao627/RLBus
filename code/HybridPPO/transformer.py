class MlpExtractor(nn.Module):
    """
    Constructs an MLP that receives the output from a previous feature extractor (i.e. a CNN) or directly
    the observations (if no feature extractor is applied) as an input and outputs a latent representation
    for the policy and a value network.
    The ``net_arch`` parameter allows to specify the amount and size of the hidden layers and how many
    of them are shared between the policy network and the value network. It is assumed to be a list with the following
    structure:

    1. An arbitrary length (zero allowed) number of integers each specifying the number of units in a shared layer.
       If the number of ints is zero, there will be no shared layers.
    2. An optional dict, to specify the following non-shared layers for the value network and the policy network.
       It is formatted like ``dict(vf=[<value layer sizes>], pi=[<policy layer sizes>])``.
       If it is missing any of the keys (pi or vf), no non-shared layers (empty list) is assumed.

    For example to construct a network with one shared layer of size 55 followed by two non-shared layers for the value
    network of size 255 and a single non-shared layer of size 128 for the policy network, the following layers_spec
    would be used: ``[55, dict(vf=[255, 255], pi=[128])]``. A simple shared network topology with two layers of size 128
    would be specified as [128, 128].

    Adapted from Stable Baselines.

    :param feature_dim: Dimension of the feature vector (can be the output of a CNN)
    :param net_arch: The specification of the policy and value networks.
        See above for details on its formatting.
